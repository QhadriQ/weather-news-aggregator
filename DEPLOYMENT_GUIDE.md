# Weather News Aggregator - Deployment Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

Since I cannot directly create a GitHub repository for you, please follow these steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `weather-news-aggregator`
4. Description: `Weather News Aggregator App with React Native and TypeScript`
5. Make it public
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
cd "q:\java job\task1"
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-news-aggregator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. API Keys Setup
Before running the app, update these files with your API keys:

**File: `src/services/weatherService.ts` (Line 3)**
```typescript
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY';
```

**File: `src/services/newsService.ts` (Line 3)**
```typescript

```

### 4. Get API Keys
